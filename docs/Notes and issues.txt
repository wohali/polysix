I've disassembled this program because I was interested in
tape dump protocol and memory organization of the external
RAM. The result is commented assembly code and a two text
files explaining organization and tape protocol.

If one would like to make sense of it, one will still need
a service manual for either Polysix or Trident mk2 and some
basic knowledge of (Intel-specific) assembly code.


About the program:

First of all I must mention that this was my first MCS-48
code I've ever seen (I did some basic coding with MCS-51,
though), and also the very first code I've disassembled,
therefore there might be some errors regarding my lack of
experience.

I was impressed with the program. It uses up all 8048's 
program and data space up to the last byte, meaning that
there was probably severe optimizing taking place to make
it fit, yet the whole code is "spagetti-free". In fact,
figuring out what some portion of the program does was a
breeze since all routines are neatly organized.


Issues:

No issues at the moment (except my lack of patience for
making better documentation ;-) ).
