INTERNAL RAM

Flags:

F0 - has two functions:
     a) holds most significant bit of external RAM address
        when micro is accessing it
     b) signals micro if it needs to check Write Enable switch
        position; this is done before micro starts to read
        tape data 

F1 - this flag holds the state of tape input as it was when
	the input was last red by the program 

Registers:

All registers have more than one routine-specific uses,
except one:

bank1, r6 - holds the first byte address of external RAM to which
	    the current patch is saved or new patch is loaded from

For description of other register please read the comments along
disassembled program code.	

Other memory locations:

14h - Program (number) LED states
15h - Bank, Manual, Write LED states
16h - Program (number) button states
17h - Bank, Manual, Write button states

20...2Fh - Patch data: this data is passed to the DAC and to
	   synth's analog circuit. Initially this is where the
           patch data from the external RAM is stored. If the
           user alters a certain parameter, the corresponding
           manual flag is set and parameter's data is constanly
           overwritten with the manual setting (current front
           panel setting).
	   
30...3Fh - Manual (current front panel) settings

Flag registers:

0C,0Dh - CV movement flags: flag is set when corresponding
         parameter changes for more than 2, which means the
         user have altered the parameter. After the flag is
         set, every change of value is added to original
         parameter value

0E,0Fh - Min/Max flags register: flag set if corresponding 
	 parameter's potentiometer is turned fully CW or
         fully CCW.

10,11h - CV manual flags: flag set if corresponding parameter
         was altered by user, the min/max flag was set, and 
         the parameter's potentiometer isn't in fully CW(CCW)
         position any more. When this flag is set, the current
         potentiometer value is directly transmitted to DAC. 
         When Manual button is pressed, all manual flags are set.

12,13h - Switch manual flags: flag set if corresponding parameter
         was altered by user. When Manual button is pressed,
         all manual flags are set.

A side note: You might have noticed that there is a large
  portion of reserved stack space used for registers. This
  is because the maximum code nesting depth is only two
  levels, so only four of the reserved 16 bytes are used
  as stack space.
